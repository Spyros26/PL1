#StayHome Project

A map is given.
Sotiris (whose starting position is S) wants to go home (position T) before the infection (starts at W) blocks his way. If the infection reaches an airport (A in map)
in 5 time units travels to every other airport in the map.
Sotiris moves twice as fast as the infection spreads but doesn't uses airports. (1 time unit for every move Sotiris makes and 2 time units for the infection to spread to its neighors)
Xs on the map are blocks and dots (.) are open spaces.
Find the shortest way home if possible (lexicographically smaller solutions are prefered).

example input:
$ cat s1.txt
S........XAW
A........XXX
............

......A....T

example output:
