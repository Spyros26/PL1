#Vaccine Project

There are two stacks. Their elements are called bases.
There are 4 bases: A G U C.
The first stack is full (tis is the one that is given) and the second is empty.

There are 3 moves.
1. push: pops the base from the first stack and pushes it to the second.
2. complement: replaces its base of the first stack with its complement base (A-U G-C).
3. reverse: reverses the 2nd stack.

The vaccine is safe when every base is on the second stack and they are all in groups (e.g. AAAGGGUUUCCC).
Find the shortest succesion of moves that result in a safe vaccine (lexicographically smaller solutions are prefered).
